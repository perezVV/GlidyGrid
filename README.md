Independent 3D game project.

Can be played either in [browser](https://perezvv.github.io/GlidyGrid/) or can be downloaded on [Itch](https://vprez.itch.io/glidy-grid/).

Unity projects tend to lag on Chromium based browsers, so it is recommended to either switch to a separate browser or download the ZIP version.

Controls:
- WASD/Arrow Keys
- Left mouse button to restart upon death
